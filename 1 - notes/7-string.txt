What is String ?

- String is a collection of characters or it is a sequence of data. 
- which can be represented by " " or ' ' in python. 

Example - 

    name = "dexter"
    fullname = 'dexter morgan'

    print(name)
    print(fullname)


- String has index number to access individual character of it

    print(name[2])  --> x

- Multi line String 

--> To store multiple lines inside of a single variable we use multiline string 

Example 1 - 

    sentence = """
        this is a msg
        this is a msg1
        this is a msg2
        this is a msg3
        this is a msg4
        this is a msg5
    """

    print(sentence)

Example 2 - 

    sentence = '''
        this is a msg
        this is a msg1
        this is a msg2
        this is a msg3
        this is a msg4
        this is a msg5
    '''

    print(sentence)


- Since strings are arrays, we can loop through the characters in a string, with a for loop.
    Example - 
        for x in "banana":
        print(x)


- To get the length of a string, use the len() function.

    a = "Hello, World!"
    print(len(a))

- To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in.

    txt = "The best things in life are free!"
    print("free" in txt) --> True


    txt = "The best things in life are free!"
    if "free" in txt:
        print("Yes, 'free' is present.")

- To check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present in a string, we can use the keyword not in.

    txt = "The best things in life are free!"
    print("expensive" not in txt)

    txt = "The best things in life are free!"
    if "expensive" not in txt:
        print("No, 'expensive' is NOT present.")






name = "Dexter Morgan"

sen = """
This occurs automatically when Python converts a data type to another, usually from a smaller to a larger data type, to prevent data loss. For example, when adding an integer to a float, Python will automatically convert the integer to a float before performing the addition.
"""


Output --> 

1. xter
2. Morgan
3. automatically when Python converts a data type to another

4. DEXTER MORGAN
5. dexter morgan
6. dexter - This occurs automatically when Python converts a data type to another
lowercase, sep, slicing

print(lower(name[0:6]), sen[0:x], sep = " - ")
