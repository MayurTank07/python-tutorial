ENCAPSULATION --> 

 - BINDING OR WRAPPING ALL THE DATA TOGETHER IN A SINGLE UNIT.
    e.g - modules, classes 

 - Encapsulation in Python is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

 - It refers to bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit.


Python Encapsulation Syntax- 

    Public: Accessible from anywhere (name)

    Protected: Meant to be accessed within the class or subclass (_name)

    Private: Can only be accessed inside the class (__name)


Encapsulation provide data hiding property and security.

TO PERFORM ENCAPSULATION YOU MUST DECLARE VARIABLES AS PRIVATE AND ACCESS THEM FROM PUBLIC METHODS.
